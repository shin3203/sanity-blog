# Vercel Deployment Issue - Ultra AI Theme Not Deploying

## Problem
The Ultra AI theme is successfully built and working locally, but Vercel continues to deploy an older version of the site.

## Verification Steps Taken
1. ‚úÖ Local build shows correct theme (CSS size: 69.89 kB)
2. ‚úÖ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub main branch
3. ‚úÖ Repository URL correct: https://github.com/shin3203/sanity-blog.git
4. ‚úÖ Latest commit: c58e7ee (Force Vercel to rebuild with diagnostic commands)
5. ‚ùå Vercel deployment shows old theme (CSS size: 32.06 kB)
6. ‚ùå No Ultra AI theme console logs in production
7. ‚ùå deployment-check.txt file not accessible
8. ‚ùå Theme verification banner not visible

## Root Cause
Vercel is not pulling/building from the latest GitHub repository state. Possible causes:
- Wrong branch configured in Vercel
- Different repository connected
- Deployment frozen/paused
- Git integration disconnected

## Solution Required
Please check your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "sanity-blog-public" project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Git
4. Verify:
   - Production Branch: `main`
   - Repository: `shin3203/sanity-blog`
   - Latest deployment commit hash should be: `c58e7ee`

If the settings are correct but deployment is still wrong:
1. Try "Redeploy" from the Vercel dashboard
2. Or disconnect and reconnect the Git integration
3. Or create a new Vercel project from the same repository

## Quick Test
After fixing, visit: https://sanity-blog-public.vercel.app/deployment-check.txt
- If you see the deployment check text file ‚Üí Issue fixed ‚úÖ
- If you see the HTML page ‚Üí Issue persists ‚ùå

## Expected Result
When properly deployed, you should see:
- Purple-cyan banner at top saying "üöÄ ULTRA AI THEME v0.0.2"
- Black hole effect in the center
- Quantum particles floating around
- Console logs showing theme verification
